# Workshop: Get up and running with Jenkins on Azure

This is a Workshop delivered at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2018 on Monday, September 17, 2018

>The Azure marketplace has several Jenkins offerings from CloudBees, Kubernetes, Docker, Bitnami and others to help you spin up Azure Jenkins instances. We will introduce a set of plugins that will enable seamless deployments to Azure containers, storage repositories, VMs and other cloud resources from your Jenkins instance. Workshop steps will take you through using Jenkins on VMs, Kubernetes and App Services, and how to integrate with other cloud services for testing and deployment. At the end of this workshop you will be able to quickly set up Jenkins in the cloud for continuous integration, deployment and delivery scenarios.

 
The workshop uses the Azure portal and CLI to set up a scalable, enterprise-grade Jenkins server on Azure secured with single sign-on (SSO). The architecture also uses Azure Monitor to scale, deploy artifacts, and monitor the state of the Jenkins servers.
